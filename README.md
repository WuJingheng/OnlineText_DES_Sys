# OnlineText_DES_Sys
DES Encryption/Decryption System for online text only.  

#Project Description  
In this project, you are required to implement the DES algorithm by following the description in FIPS PUB 46-3: Data Encryption Standard, published by NIST on October 25, 1999.

#Reference  
Data Encryption Standard (DES) by NIST, FIPS PUB 46-3, October 25, 1999 (Reaffirmed). You can access the document at: http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips46-3/fips46-3.pdf.

#Requirements  
No specific requirement on the development environment or tools that you would use to do the project. That is, you are free to use any development environment of your choice. As the outcome of this project, however, you are required to:  
(1)	implement both the encryption and the decryption part of the DES algorithm;  
(2)	design and implement a user-friendly interface to demonstrate the input and the output of your algorithm.
